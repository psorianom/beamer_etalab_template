# beamer_etalab_template
LaTeX template for (my) Etalab presentations. In Beamer (metropolis theme).  

This repo contains a very simple template for my (or others) Etalab presentations using the [Metropolis](https://github.com/matze/mtheme) Beamer's theme.
In order to use this, you need to have a LaTeX distribution and said theme installed. Also Firefox Fira Fonts to have a nicer result.

# Example

![Alt text](/fig/example2.png?raw=true "Normal Slide")
